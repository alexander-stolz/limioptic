Under some Linux systems there is a known bug which causes the vtkRenderWindowInteractor to slow down the program enormously. Plot->PyQtGraph should work until this problem is fixed.


<b>Installation (Windows):</b>

1. Download the Limioptic 2 folder
2. If you don't have VTK (or DeVIDE) and PyQt4 installed download "Limioptic 2 - portable (Windows).exe" and unpack it to the same folder.


<b>Installation (Linux):</b>

1. Download the Limioptic 2 folder
2. Install python-qt4 and python-vtk and <a href="http://www.pyqtgraph.org/">PyQtGraph</a> (depends on numpy and scipy)
