## using pipx
1. install [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx): `python3.8 -m pip install pipx --user`
2. install limioptic: `pipx install limioptic`
3. start limioptic from everywhere with `limioptic`

## pipenv
1. `python3.8 -m pipenv shell`
2. `pipenv install limioptic`

## poetry
1. `poetry init`
2. Python version `>=3.7,<3.10`
